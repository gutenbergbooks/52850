  <h2 class='c004'>Preface.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>By way of explaining the dual character
of this little book, we here indulge
a few brief introductory remarks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Part First is designed simply as a
manual of instruction for barbers, and
we hope it will, in a valuable measure,
supply a long felt need. It will prove
especially beneficial to the younger and
less experienced members of our craft.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best artisans and artists admit
they owe much to the accumulated
knowledge and experience of both their
predecessors and their contemporaries.
Indeed, to assert any claim to advanced
knowledge and skill, without due acknowledgements
for the help received
from others would savor of an inexcusable
egotism. The man who professes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>to be a self-made man is always
notorious for worshiping his maker.</p>

<p class='c000'>We should, of course, always put
our own impress upon all our work.
Our observations on the methods of
others should supplement but not supplant
our own originality and our own
reason. A noted artist when asked
how he mixed his paints to achieve such
wonderful results, replied: “I mix
them with brains.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So must we use our own brains as
well as the brains of others, if we would
succeed in this day of rapid improvements
and sharp competition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The information given in this book
is not guess work, but the result of
long years of study and practice.
Thirty-one years have I conducted a
shop of my own. During these years
every recipe here given has been
thoroughly tested. We know they are
all good.</p>

<p class='c000'>Part Second is devoted to taxidermy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>which for twenty-three years I have
connected with my other shop work.
I have preserved and sold hundreds of
specimens, and this work has proven a
source of much pleasure and profit,
enabling me to turn many otherwise
idle moments into money.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this line I have not confined myself
to taxidermic work alone, but have
also connected the tanning of hides
with the hair on, which I have manufactured
into mats, rugs, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hence this little book, under a twofold
title, practically includes three
trades.</p>

<p class='c000'>We offer it as a money saving and
money making investment. The recipes
and other information contained
herein will enable any barber to make
all his own preparations, and to manufacture
them for sale. He may
also connect taxidermy and tanning if
it suit his pleasure and business.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>Historic Sketch.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The word barber is derived from the
Latin word “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">barba</span>,” which means
beard, and hence is applied to one
whose occupation is to shave and trim
beards and cut hair. The barber's craft
is a very ancient one. The practice of
shaving was common among the ancient
Egyptians, Greeks and Romans; and
was even mentioned by the prophet
Ezekiel, chapter v, 1st verse. Among
the ancient Israelites the removal of the
beard by shaving or plucking was a
sign of mourning. It would seem that
the origin of our trade was prehistoric.</p>

<p class='c000'>In early times barbering was conjoined
with surgery, and the barber
also served the public in the capacity
of surgeon. In France the barber-chirurgeons,
or barber-surgeons, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>separated from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perruquiers</span>, or
wig-makers, and were incorporated as
a distinct body in the latter part of the
17th century. In England barbers
were incorporated with special privileges
in 1461, and were afterwards
united to the society of surgeons, but
were confined to the minor operations
of blood letting and drawing teeth. In
1745 an act was passed, the preamble
of which declared the trade of the barber
and the profession of surgery are
foreign to and independent of each
other.</p>

<p class='c000'>This act practically divorced surgery
from the barber's chair. However,
quite recently the surgeons of the
Swedish navy were also barbers for the
crew. In former times, not far remote,
it was customary to keep a lute
or a violin for the entertainment of
patrons, which made the shop a favorite
resort for idle persons. In China
and some other oriental countries, barbers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>not only shave the face, but they
also shave the whole or a part of the
head.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>BARBER'S SIGN.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Though barbering is now entirely
separated from surgery, yet a monument
of their former union may be
still seen in the striped pole and basin
so often projecting from the front of
barber shops.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fillet, or spiral strip around the
pole symbolizes the winding of a ribbon
round the arm previous to letting
blood, and its red color symbolizes the
blood. The basin, yet sometimes seen
at the base, represents a vessel prepared
to catch the blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barber's poles in this country are
tri-colored. The white symbolizes the
arm, the red represents the shed blood,
while Americans have added the blue
to complete our national colors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Directions.</span>—Formula No. 1, and
formula No. 2, should each be put up
in a separate bottle.</p>

<p class='c000'>In compounding, each of the first two
ingredients should be combined and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>reduced to a solution and the water
then added.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before using these preparations the
beard or hair should first be thoroughly
washed and dried.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then apply No. 1 with the fingers,
and when partly dried apply No. 2
with a tooth brush and a comb, being
careful to get the dye down to the skin.
If convenient let the party go out into
the open air for an hour. Otherwise
the hair should be thoroughly dried
with a fan, and washed with soap and
soft water. This formula was brought
from Germany by a St. Louis barber
and sold to the author in 1869. Properly
put up it is not only first-class, but
I have never found any other preparation
equal to it.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>BROWN HAIR DYE.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Take four pounds of green walnut
hulls. Put them in 1½ gallons soft
water and boil down to three pints.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Strain off through cloth until clear of
sediment. To one quart of this add one
quart of alcohol, and 3 ounces of glycerine.
Use as other restorers, once a
day until the desired shade is obtained.
The hulls should be gathered in August.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>QUININE HAIR TONIC AND SEA FOAM.</h3>

<p class='c007'>The strong point in favor of this
preparation as a sea-foam is that it acts
at the same time as a tonic for the hair.</p>

into an ounce of alcohol. When the
menthol is thoroughly dissolved add
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>this combination to ½ gallon of the
cream. The presence of the menthol
gives this preparation a very pleasant
cooling effect. Hence it is well named.
This cream may, of course, be perfumed
if desirable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instead of these face creams, some
customers will prefer the pure bay rum,
while perhaps many will prefer witch
hazel. These can, of course, be obtained
from barber supply houses or
from drug stores; the witch hazel may
be improved by adding to it a good
cologne. Try two parts witch hazel to
one part cologne.</p>

oil of cloves (or some other perfume), if
desirable. Finally pour off in small
jelly jars and set away for use. 1 gallon
made in this way will make 5 gallons of
ordinary shampoo, by simply adding 4
gallons more of water. This quantity
should not cost over fifty cents. A
pound of the refined carbonate of potash
costs twenty cents, and a pound of
castile soap only fifteen cents, and the
perfume will cost less than the remainder
of 50 cents.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shampoo or sea-foam can be

pure soft water may be used instead of
the witch hazel; but the preparation
would sour in warm weather. Apply
with a soft cloth.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>BARBERS' ITCH.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Fear of this disease causes many men
to shave themselves, and this class
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>would otherwise be among the very
best customers.</p>

<p class='c000'>When these men observe how careless
the average barber is with his
towels, mugs, tools, etc., they become
disgusted and purchase a shaving outfit
and quit the barbers' chair, except when
they want a hair-cut.</p>

<p class='c000'>I believe every barber should know
how to treat this disease. Hence I will
make a few suggestions as to its causation
and treatment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scabies, or itch, in its various forms
is a disease caused by the irritation produced
from the presence in the skin of
what is called the itch mite and the ova
of the same. The cure involves the destruction
of these parasites. Get a
doctor, if possible, to prescribe; if no
doctor can be got who understands it, I
would try the following: An ointment
made from the flour of sulphur and
lard or sulphur and vaseline, is about
the best remedy known. Rub in well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>at night and wash off in morning. Or
take citron ointment 1 ounce and mutton
tallow 1 ounce. Melt together and
stir till cool. This I have found one of
the best salves for all skin diseases I
have ever tried. Apply twice a day, but
use with care since it contains mercury.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>HAIR OILS AND HAIR DRESSINGS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>While oiling the hair is a thing of
the past, we might indulge a few remarks
as a matter of history. Thirty
years ago almost every customer used
oil on his hair, and every barber was
expected to know how to mix his own
oils. A favorite preparation was made
as follows: 1 pint of alcohol and 1½
pints of castor-oil were shaken together,
and then perfumed with citronella
or bergamot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another favorite was made of raccoon
oil and lard mixed half and half,
and perfumed with the oil of cloves.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Some used the coon oil straight;
others used the oil of birds, geese,
chickens or ducks, etc. Bear oil was
considered a great oil for the hair as
well as for many other purposes. My
own favorite among all the home made
preparations was made from beef
marrow. The marrow was tried out
and a little salt was added. The oil
was then perfumed with bergamot.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>POMADES.</h3>

<p class='c007'>In selecting material for pomade,
have a butcher get you some fine leaf
lard and some of the finest suet, which
should be taken from young animals.
Render out separately in porcelain vessels
and strain off.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Directions.</span>—Take lard 1 pound, tallow
1 pound; mix them and heat gently,
and cook for one hour over a slow fire;
remove and let stand a few minutes to
settle; now pour off carefully. When
almost cold add some suitable perfume,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>say oil of bergamot 4 drachms, oil of
lemon 3 drachms, oil of cassia 2
drachms, oil of nutmeg 75 drops. Mix
thoroughly with the pomade and pour
into small jars.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>STICK POMADES.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Take of the prepared tallow 1 pound,
pure, clean bees wax 3 ounces, gum
benzoin, in a coarse powder, 1¼ drachms.
Melt together with a slow heat, mixing
all the while. When partly cooled add
some suitable perfume. Pour it off in
moulds and when cold take out and
wrap in tin foil, then put on a nice
label as outer covering.</p>

<p class='c000'>To make the above into a coloring
pomade, take 3 pounds of the prepared
lard and tallow, before being perfumed;
add to it 2 pounds of fresh walnut hulls,
cut up fine; put into a porcelain vessel
and heat gently for four hours. Take
off and strain, and proceed as in making
the black pomade. This will gradually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>color the hair or beard to a nice brown
by being used daily until the desired
shade is obtained.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>HOW TO STOP BLOOD.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Every barber should have at hand a
preparation for stopping blood. The
best of barbers are liable to bring blood
from rough or tender faces. An astringent
pencil, which is very good
and very handy, may be obtained from
the barber supply houses in the cities
at a cost of only 10 cents each. However,
I prefer Monsell's Powdered Iron
which may be obtained from any drug
store. The only objection to it is, it is
liable to discolor the skin. However,
by being careful to put on only a small
amount, it may easily be washed off
when the blood has ceased to ooze.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a small bump has been cut off or
a shallow cut made in the smooth skin,
it will generally suffice to cover it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>with a thick lather and let it remain until
the shaving is completed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Alum is also used but is too slow in
its action.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>HAIR RESTORERS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>I could give a formula that would
make the hair fall out, but thus far I
have not been able to find a preparation
that will produce a new growth of hair
on bald heads. As a preventative treatment
I might suggest as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>Boil burdock root in soft water until
strong, and then add to one pint of it, a
half pint of alcohol, a teaspoonful of
salt, and 1 ounce of glycerine. This
used once a day will prevent the hair
from falling out. Or make a strong
decoction of black tea or sage and mix
with the alcohol, salt, and glycerine
as above and use as above.</p>

<p class='c000'>The basis of most hair tonics is the
tincture of cantharides, quinine, ammonia,
camphor, and salt. A solution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>of borax in camphor water is used by
some as a stimulant for the scalp. I
have a friend who is experimenting on
a new line with very encouraging prospects
of successfully producing hair on
bald heads. If any party interested
will address me a few months hence, I
may be able to advise them how to reproduce
hair on bald heads.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>GLASS HONES.</h3>

<p class='c007'>A glass hone is easily made, and no
barber should be without one. Procure
a piece of heavy plate glass and
have a glass cutter cut it into pieces
3×8 inches in dimensions. Take the
gloss off the face and also around the
edges on a grindstone, and then finish
by rubbing the face of the hone with
pumice-stone kept wet with water.
Continue this rubbing until the gloss is
entirely removed and the hone is
smooth. Before honing take a rubber,
such as is used on a water hone, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>after wetting hone rub until you have
a sort of lather. Hone on this as you
would on any other hone. You will
find it excellent for smoothing shears
after grinding, or a razor after having
been over honed.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>MUGS, BRUSHES AND SOAPS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>The mug should be large and heavy
and the brush used to make the lather
should also be large and first-class in
every particular. In regard to brushes,
I would suggest that it pays to buy the
very best.</p>

<p class='c000'>A poor brush that is continually
shedding hairs is very annoying to the
customer, and it hinders the barber. I
prefer the rubber ferruled brush, but
be sure to get the genuine.</p>

<p class='c000'>In regard to soap I must admit that
I am partial to the J. B. Williams barber
soap. However, there are other
brands that give good satisfaction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>There are no soaps too good. Hence
get the best.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>FACE POWDERS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>There is nothing much better than
cake magnesia, but it should only be
used to dry the face after shaving. I
have given a liquid whiting which is
much used by ladies. I have often used
it on men to whiten the skin. See
whitening for the face.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>SHOWER BATH AND SHAMPOO CAN.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Take a common tin bucket which
holds three gallons, have a small tube
one inch long and one quarter of an
inch in diameter put in one side about
one half inch from bottom of bucket.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then get a rubber hose three feet
long of suitable diameter to fit on to
the tube. At the other extremity of
the hose attach a sprinkler with its tubular
end made to fit the hose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Connect the hose to bucket and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>sprinkler to hose, and the can is complete.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lay the sprinkler over the upper
rim of can (or bucket) to keep the
water from flowing out. Fill with soft
warm water; and, when ready to take
the bath or shampoo, hang from ceiling
or set on shelf high enough to allow the
water to flow over the head and body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Put on the shampoo. Take the
sprinkler and thoroughly wash and
rinse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three gallons of water used in this
way is better than a whole bath tub full
used in the ordinary way. This apparatus
of course applies to country places
where they have not the advantage of
water works, or where the water furnished
is hard.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>TOWELS, HAIR CLOTHS, AND FACE CLOTHS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>If you would secure first-class trade,
you must keep a good supply of clean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>good looking towels. Nothing is more
disgusting in a shop than a lot of dirty
ragged towels.</p>

<p class='c000'>The workmen may be first-class, the
tools first-class, etc.; but unless the
towels are in proper condition the better
class of trade will go elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>I prefer a good moderate sized cotton
towel, except for the wash cloth, where
I prefer a cotton crash towel on the
order of a bath towel.</p>

<p class='c000'>This crash comes in bolts and may
be cut the desired length; it must, however,
be hemmed. For the bath always
use a good towel but not too large.</p>

<p class='c000'>The breast cloth made of calico or
gingham, should be full width of goods,
and not less than three and a half feet
long. It should have a half neck opening
at one side made to fit up around
the neck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hair cloth may be made of calico,
gingham or bleached sheeting. If
the sheeting is used get the goods wide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>enough to require no seam, and then
border with a two inch band of red
oiled calico.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>SUGGESTIONS FOR BEGINNERS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>In the first place, if you have made
up your mind to be a barber, why not
be a good one. There is always room
at the top, and rich reward for him who
has reached the top. Rich reward,
however, is the price of self-exertion.
Do not wait for a tidal wave to waft
you on to success. The minions of
fortune are few and far between. You
must not only work but you must embrace
every opportunity to improve
your qualifications, if you would
achieve success in this age of advanced
knowledge and skill. You should
always be on the alert, and never miss
an opportunity to acquire useful information.
Knowledge is power, and it
behooves you to gain all the knowledge
you can, especially of your own business.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>If necessary pay for it, work for
it, or even beg for it. The possession
of a good fund of practical knowledge
with other necessary qualities of mind
and heart, will enable one to wear good
clothes, make plenty of money and to
have scores of friends; while the lack
of it will make another the digger of
ditches, living in rags and poverty, and
deprived of the more congenial companionship
of the better and nobler elements
of society. Knowledge pays.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, while you should attend
well to the proper equipment of your
mind, you should not neglect the
proper cultivation of your social character.
Especially should you cultivate
what might be termed a practical business
social tact.</p>

<p class='c000'>Treat every customer as though your
success depended upon him and him
alone, and always exert your utmost to
do good work. Much depends upon
the barber's ability to shave well. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>accomplish the great desideratum of
being able to shave well each one of
the various customers with their varying
qualities of beard, you must diligently
study the temper of your razors
with reference to the peculiar beard of
each customer. Again much depends
upon the lather, the brush, the hone,
the strop, etc. Hence you will please
pardon a few simple primary suggestions
leading up to a good shave. First
you must equip yourself with first-class
tools.</p>

<p class='c000'>Procure a first-class oil hone.</p>

<p class='c000'>A large rubber ferruled lather brush.</p>

<p class='c000'>A large heavy shaving mug.</p>

<p class='c000'>A half dozen No. 1 razors, 4½ to 4⅝
wide and ¾ concave.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your soap and all other materials
and implements should be as good as
you are able to buy.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you hone your razor on the
oil hone, use good soap and make a
stiff lather which you will spread on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>hone. Then place the razor on the hone
and draw very lightly from heel to
point so that the edge of the razor
will always be on the front side of the
moving blade. Each stroke across the
hone should be a sloping or sawing
stroke, and at the end of each the razor
should be turned on the back and
pushed up across the end of the hone,
and the other side of the blade laid
flat on the hone. Then draw the razor
back with a curving or angular stroke
to the other end of the hone. Turn
again as before and continue with steady
stroke until you think the blade is
sharp. Wet the thumb nail and try the
edge by drawing it lightly from end to
end. Should the edge feel blunt or
rough make a few more strokes on the
hone and try again, and so on until the
edge is satisfactory. A better way to
test the edge, if you have a smooth soft
hand, is to wet the end of thumb or
fore finger and draw the razor lightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>over it feeling of the edge. However,
it requires practice to tell with certainty
by either method. Therefore practice
carefully until you become expert.</p>

<p class='c000'>We will here make a few suggestions
in regard to the different hones
generally used by barbers. The
oil hone, which is supposed to be
petrified hickory, is the one most used,
and is perhaps the best. Second in rank
and general use comes the Swatty hone
which is made from the same material
as the emery wheel, but it is of finer
grade. This is a very fast cutting
hone. Next comes the water hone
which is simply a fine grit stone, and
then comes the glass hone which is but
little used. A few barbers use it to
take off the wire edge of over-honed
razors. Hones should be handled with
great care. In honing the razor should
be run well out to the ends to prevent
hollowing the hone. Should a hone
begin to hollow, work it down with fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>sand paper to a perfect face and smooth
it with the rubber used on the water
hones. I prefer olive oil on an oil
hone if carefully used. Of course lather
may be used on an oil hone the same as
on the Swatty and glass hones. Use
water on the water hone and rub with
the rub stone commonly used until the
surface is covered with a sort of soapy
pasty lather before honing. The glass
hone may be used in the same manner.
Any hone when not in use should be
wrapped up and laid away carefully
after having been washed and thoroughly
cleaned.</p>

<p class='c000'>You should be provided with a good
shell strop, or a good Russian leather
strop, and also a good canvas strop.
After honing strop the razor lightly on
the leather only. The canvas should
not be used except when the razor has
become smooth. When you have a
customer in the chair, first put a clean
towel on him and proceed to make the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>lather using warm soft water. Lather
the face and scour the beard, and then
lather again with a good heavy lather.
Proceed to shave, drawing the razor
with a sawing stroke, and make the
strokes as long as practicable. Hold
the skin tight to throw out the beard,
and go over the face the first time as
quickly as possible. Then wash the
soap from the face, and go over it a
second time, keeping the skin somewhat
stretched, and wet with soft water.
When finished, press a hot towel to the
face and then use one of the face creams
given in this book.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next powder the face, and curl and
perfume the mustache. If you think
his hair needs trimming tell him so,
and if he has it done, do your very
best, even taking pains to cut the hair
out of his ears. Shave his neck. The
most important point is to get a good
edge on the hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>If he takes a shampoo, first give the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>scalp a good brushing to loosen the
dandruff, and then use Silver Gloss
Shampoo, giving him to understand
that you have it for sale for family
use. Rinse hair with warm soft water,
and dry with a fine bath towel, and then
ask him if you shall apply some of the
hair tonic which will cost him only ten
cents extra.</p>

<p class='c000'>Comb his hair in the latest style,
and if he desires it, color his mustache
with the celebrated German Hair Dye.
Help him into his coat, and thanking
him bid him come again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Purchase every good book pertaining
to your business, study diligently and
practice what you learn, and you will
soon stand abreast with the best and
most progressive barbers. You should
be prompted by no meaner ambition.</p>

    <div>Taxidermy.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c005'>The word taxidermy is derived from
the two Greek words, taxis, which
means arrangement, and derma which
means skin. Hence this term is applied
to the art of preserving and
mounting the skins of animals for ornamental
and scientific purposes. Little is
known of the origin of this art, but it
would seem from books of travel and
natural history, that it is at most, not
more than three hundred years old. It
began to be practiced in England about
the beginning of the 18th century,
which fact is proven from the “Sloane
Collection” which was formed in 1825,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>as the nucleus of the present natural
history collection lodged in the galleries
of South Kensington. It was
about the middle of the 18th century
that the first book devoted to the principles
of taxidermy was published in
France. After this, others appeared
from time to time in France and Germany,
but England contributed no literature
on the subject until about the
beginning of the present century. In
1828 an Englishman named Scudder,
established a museum of mounted specimens
in an old alms house in New York
City. Previous to this, the art seems
to have been absolutely unknown in
America. It was not till the exhibition
of 1851, that the French and German
taxidermists taught the English
the principles of scientific treatment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since that time several works have
appeared from the pens of English and
American authors. Prominently among
the American writers, were Charles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Waterton and Titian R. Peale who
greatly improved the art in this country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jules Verreaux, of Paris, brought
the art to a still higher perfection, and
introduced methods for giving to specimens
a life-like expression, which elevated
it quite to the realm of higher art.
Great were his accomplishments in the
art of expressing the actions and characteristic
attitudes of the living animals.
Since his day taxidermy has
rivaled the plastic art, and today, it has
reached such a degree of perfection
that the most artistic and æsthetic
effects may be wrought by the hands of
any operator who possesses artistic faculties.
The Illinois State Natural History
Society of Bloomington, published
an illustrated pamphlet from the pen
of one Mr. Holder, which is a very valuable
contribution to taxidermic literature.
The author was doubtless
greatly improved by his associations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>with Audubon and Bell, and in his
book he gives the results of a ripe experience.
This book ranks as one of
the best yet published. We submit
the results of our own patient study
and practical experience, and hope it
may prove a worthy addition.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>ARTICLE I.<br /> <span class='large'>ON SKINNING, STUFFING AND PRESERVATION OF BIRDS.</span></h3>

<h4 class='c013'>SKINNING.</h4>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Immediately after
the bird is killed, the nostrils,
throat and wounds
should be stuffed with
cotton to prevent the
blood from oozing out
and staining the plumage;
but should any
blood get on the plumage,
it should be removed
as soon as possible.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>This can be done by taking a
cloth or sponge and dipping it in clean
water, wringing it out so as to leave it
only moist, and rubbing the feathers
gently until all traces of blood stain are
removed. Now sprinkle the feathers
with plaster of paris, and shake out
before it sets. Repeat this until they are
perfectly dry,
and then wrap
the specimen in
paper to protect
the plumage until
ready to skin,
which should be
done as soon as
the bird cools.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><em>No. 2.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In proceeding
to skin a bird,
spread a cloth on a board or table and
lay the bird on its back. Separate the
feathers on the breast with a scalpel or
knife. Insert the knife at the top of
breast-bone and cut the skin from there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>to the tail. Great care should be taken
not to cut too deep over the intestines,
as it is only necessary to cut through
the skin. Now begin where you first
inserted the knife and proceed to separate
the skin from the flesh, either with
the fingers or the back of the scalpel or
knife. Tear some small pieces of
paper, say about an inch square, and
put under the skin on the flesh as you
get them separated, which will keep
the feathers from sticking to the flesh
and becoming soiled; or sprinkling
cornmeal over the flesh and skin while
skinning, will answer the same purpose.
Press carefully down each side
to backbone. Now press the thighs forward
and inward, draw the skin from
the thighs, unjointing them at the first
joint from the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>The skin is now removed over the
rump, and the tail unjointed, taking
care not to injure the tail feathers.
Now for convenience, take a cord and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>fasten it to a nail on the wall or ceiling,
put a wire hook on the other end, and
fasten in the bird so you can suspend
it high enough above the table to work
on it easily. Now pull the skin downwards
until you get to the wings,
which are to be unjointed at the shoulder
joint. It is then pulled down over
the skull until the ears are reached.
Here many valuable specimens are
spoiled by cutting the ears too close to
the skin, so be sure to cut the ears
close to the skull.</p>

<p class='c000'>The eyelids are often spoiled also by
inexperienced hands. Be sure and cut
them well back and, if necessary, trim
them afterwards. Now remove the eyeballs
and unjoint the skull from the
neck, enlarge the opening at the base
of skull, where the neck came off, and
remove the brain with spoon made
for that purpose. Now remove the
flesh from the thigh bone down to
knee joint, and turn them back in place;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>then skin the wings out to first joint
and remove the flesh. There is yet one
job and the skinning process is completed.
Divide the feathers on the under
side of the wing between the second
and third joints, cut the skin, and with
a sharp knife cut out all flesh from the
bone, and put in some of the preserving
powder; cover it with a little cotton
and sew it up, being careful not to draw
any of the feathers in; press the feathers
down smooth, and see that each is
in its proper place.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are some birds with large
heads and small necks. With these we
cannot draw the skin over the head,
but have to push the skin as near the
head as it is possible, and cut off the
neck bone; then make an opening under
the throat large enough to turn out
the skull and the remaining part of the
neck bone, and proceed to skin the skull,
take out brain, etc., as directed heretofore.
The flesh must be carefully removed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>from all parts of the skin, and
the preserving powder applied, being
very careful that all parts are well powdered.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you now wish to mount the bird
it can be done immediately.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>STUFFING BIRDS.</h4>

<p class='c007'>In the first place take some plaster
paris, mix it with water to a stiff paste,
and fill the eye-sockets with it, then
press the glass eye in the paris, using
great care to set them in as near a natural
position as possible. When the
plaster has hardened, which it does
very quickly, if the skin has become
dry, dampen it with a damp sponge,
and turn it back over the skull, then
lay the bird on the table and proceed
to put in the frame, stuff and sew up.</p>

<p class='c000'>I give three kinds of frames. One
is the wire and wood frame, which you
see on page <a href='#Page_78'>78</a>, Figs. 9 and 10. The
others, wire frames, on page <a href='#Page_80'>80</a>, Fig. 3,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>for birds; also Fig. 11, for humming
birds and other small birds, on page <a href='#Page_78'>78</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Take frame described Nos. 9 and 10,
having the leg wire AA detached from
body board, fill the neck with tow, being
careful not to fill it too full; run
neck wire E through the center of the
neck and pass it out at the top of head,
as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, or through
one of the nostrils. I prefer the latter,
because it does not break the skin and
holds the head more steady. Then put
the tail support E through the center
or heavy part of the tail, raise the body
board and place under it some tow or
cotton; or pad the board by placing
some cotton on it and tacking some
cloth over it to keep the frame off from
the back; then take the leg wires, Fig.
13, AA and put them in the legs, as
shown in cut No. 3, and fasten on to the
body board with blind staples, as represented
in cut No. 3; proceed with the
stuffing; finish filling out the neck and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>breast, shaping it while filling, using
care not to get it too full, as that is a
fault of most beginners; after filling it
down to the opening, the next should
be the legs; if the leg bone is left in
from the knee up, wrap it to the leg
wire with a strip of muslin and tie it;
then stuff the leg up to the body, fill
the body and sew up; in sewing be careful
not to draw any of the feathers
down with the thread. After it is all
sewed up, place all the feathers down
smooth and in their proper place, as
much depends on this.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next place the specimen on a board
or perch; if on a board, procure a suitable
one, bore two holes the size of the
leg wires through it, then make a
groove on the under side of board running
off from each hole to lay wire
down in; place the specimen on the
board, running the leg wires through
it, and draw the wires down until the
legs set in proper position, bend the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>wires down into the grooves and fasten
them with small blind staples. In this
connection one should use his own judgment
in placing the bird on the board;
one leg should generally be placed a little
in advance of the other. If the bird
is to be placed on a limb perch, bore
the holes through the limb, place the
bird on, and draw the wires tight, and
drive a wooden wedge in beside the
wire to hold it, then file the wire off
close to the under side of the perch.
Pose the bird in as natural a position as
you can, imitating nature as near as
possible. Place the wings in position,
then take a piece of wire heavy enough
to hold the wings in place. Sharpen one
end, and make a square turn about one-fourth
of an inch from the other end
to keep it from pulling through the wing.
Now place the wings in proper shape.
Pass the wire through the wings and body
in a way to hold them in shape. Pull
the wire until the turn on the one end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>presses against the wing. Cut the wire
on other side of bird and turn it back,
as on the other side, so that the wire
cannot be pulled either way; then arrange
the whole body—wings, neck,
tail, head, etc. In case the specimen
is a web-footed bird, take a thin piece
of board, say from a cigar box, cut it
to fit in between the toes, and tack
them in to hold the web in shape while
drying. This should be removed when
dry. After all is completed bathe the
buts of wings, the feet, legs and beak,
with the preserving fluid; this should
be repeated for three or four days.
Then let the specimen dry in a shady
place. It can then be placed on another
board or perch and set in the cabinet.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>MOUNTING BIRDS ON WIRE FRAME.</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>(See directions for making frame.)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Skin the bird and prepare it as
directed in this article. Fill the neck
with tow, put in neck wire, letting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>end come out through the nostril; bend
leg wires AA back so as to get them
in the legs; run them down on the inside
of the leg, or through the center
of leg bone, and come out in the center
of the foot. (See cuts Nos. 2 and 3.)
Put tail support E through the under
part of the tail, and proceed as directed
heretofore in this article, to
stuff, sew up, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where the tow can not be secured
and you have to use cotton in stuffing,
always put in the neck wire first, and
stuff around it or wrap the neck wire
with strips of muslin, old calico, or
anything that can be used for that purpose,
always being careful not to make
the neck too large. Excelsior can be
used to good advantage in stuffing large
bodies.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>PELICANS.</h4>

<p class='c007'>In dressing a pelican always use the
board and wire frame. For position,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>copy after some picture of the bird,
which you can find in any natural history.
The only difference in dressing
from the goose, etc., is they have a
game sack under the lower jaw, which
is often as much as ten inches wide and
sixteen inches long. I find the best
way to dress that is to take a fine shingle,
wide and long enough, and trim it
in the shape of a sleigh runner, and
put it inside of the pouch or game sack,
with the straight edge up and the
square end toward the neck. Draw
the pouch smooth over the shingle,
and tie the bill together, then wet well
with the solution of corrosive sublimate.
The board should be left in.
Wire can be bent and placed in to answer
the same purpose.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>PEA-FOWL.</h4>

<p class='c007'>In dressing a pea-fowl, where the
wings and tail have to be spread, extra
wires have to be put in. The wires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>for the wings are fastened on to the
body board, as when used for the fore
legs of animals. Then, for the tail
support, take a wire about five feet
long and bend it in a hoop shape, leaving
enough of the ends to extend into
and fasten on the body board. This
must be put on the board before putting
it in the body. Dress the bird as
others, letting the hoop or tail support
extend out under the tail. After it is
all stuffed and set on the board, bend
the tail support up back of tail, and
fasten the feathers of the tail to it by
tying them, one at a time, with a heavy
thread, in such a way that when all are
fastened to the wire they will stand as
when the bird was strutting. Arrange
the wings and body to suit and let dry.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>DRESSING BIRDS WITH WINGS SPREAD.</h4>

<p class='c007'>To dress a bird with wings spread,
either flying or sitting, it will be necessary
to put in wing wires to hold the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>wings out. The easiest way is to use the
wire and board frame, using the front
leg wires as used in animals, for the
wings. See Figs. 7 and 8, board and
body frame.</p>

<p class='c000'>In dressing a bird this way, after
skinning and wiring, as directed for
bird, using frames 9 and 10, put in the
wing wires and fasten them to body
board, as directed for forelegs of animals.</p>

<p class='c000'>If wishing to represent the bird as
flying, take four cords and fasten them
to the back of the bird in a way that
will balance it; tie them together a few
inches above the back and extend one
cord longer than the others. It can
now be hung from the ceiling by the
cord; this will let the specimen turn
about and present a fine appearance.
The feet should be placed in as near a
natural position as possible as when
flying. In all large footed birds use
plenty of the solution of corrosive sublimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>or turpentine. The carbolic acid
and water mixture is also used, and is
good.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>TO CLEAN FEATHERS.</h4>

<p class='c007'>As a test case take a bird after killing
and smear it all over with blood,
let it lie until dry. Then put it in a
basin, and give it a good washing with
soap and water, then rinse it clean.
Now take a dry cloth and wipe it until
almost dry. Then sprinkle it with dry
plaster of paris and shake it out before
it has time to set. Repeat this powdering
and shaking until it is perfectly
dry, and the feathers will look bright
and nice. Try it.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>PRESERVATION OF BUGS, ETC.</h4>

<p class='c007'>Take a large moth fly or miller full
of eggs. Make an incision on the under
side of body and take out all the eggs
and entrails. Now put in some of the
preserving fluid and fill the cavity with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>cotton and sew it up. Then run a pin
down through the body and pin it to a
board. Arrange its feet, moisten its
body with the preserving fluid and the
job is complete. Butterflies and small
bugs need only the preparation over
the body. Heavy bugs can be placed
in a cup and the preparation poured
over them. Let them lie in it a few
hours and pin on board as directed in
moth flies. When dry place in a glass
case.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>ARTICLE II.<br /> OF SKINNING ANIMALS.</h3>

<p class='c005'>As soon as an animal is killed, take
cotton and stuff in the wounds, nostrils
and mouth, as directed in Article I. for
birds; then let it cool before commencing
to skin. In skinning a specimen
be very careful about cutting holes in
the skin, and also not to stretch it by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>pulling on it while skinning. All being
ready, lay the specimen on its back,
make an incision from the breast-bone
back to the center between the hind
legs, being careful not to cut too deep
over the abdomen. Divide the skin
right and left, putting cotton or paper
on the body as the skin is removed, or
sprinkle with corn meal, as directed for
birds in Article I, to prevent the fatty
matter from soiling the hair. When
you come to the hind legs, pull the skin
down over the thigh joint, and unjoint
it, cut the leg off and skin down to the
knee joint and unjoint there, taking out
all the flesh down to the foot, then
treat the other hind leg the same way.
Now skin down over the rump and
back to the tail. The tail is hard to
skin. Take a forked stick, and after
pressing the skin as far down on the
tail-bone as possible, holding the bone
as tight in the fork as you can, pull
downward and the bone will slip out.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>If the animal is not too large it should
be swung up with a rope or cord tied
around the body just in front of the
hind legs, or by attaching a hook to the
rope which fastens into the flesh. Remove
the skin down to the forelegs,
and unjoint them at the body, and skin
out in the same manner as directed for
the hind legs, unjointing at the knees.
Now skin the neck and head, and when
you come to the ears cut them close to
the skull; fine specimens are often
spoiled by cutting them too far out
from the skull. We next come to the
eyes. Be careful not to cut the eyelids.
It is better to cut close to the skull and
trim afterwards than to risk spoiling
them. Remove the skin. Unjoint the
neck close to the skull, enlarge the
opening at the base of brain and remove
all the brains. Take out the eyes and
tongue and remove all flesh from the
skull.</p>

<p class='c000'>This completes the skinning, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>when the animal has horns. In that
case, proceed as above until you come
to the neck. Skin as far forward as
you can and unjoint the neck at skull.
Then cut across from one horn to
the other and loosen the skin around
the horns. Then make another cut
from between the horns backwards
along the neck far enough to make the
opening large enough to take the skull
out; skin out the skull and the skinning
is completed. The flesh must now be
cleaned from the skull by boiling until
tender, then scraping it, or simply by
cutting and scraping it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Take out the brains, eyes, etc., we
are now ready to anoint the whole
inside of skin, skull, etc., with the
preserving powder. Put in the frame
and stuff the body if ready; if not, the
ears, nose, feet and lips must be well
wet with the preserving fluid and laid
away in a cool, dry place.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
  <h4 class='c013'>STUFFING AND MOUNTING ANIMALS.</h4>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i069.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><em>No. 4.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After the skin is prepared,
we will begin by
preparing the skull.
After cleaning as directed
anoint it with the
preserving powder, then
put in suitable eyes, as
directed in birds. Now
if the legs are large
enough to take in
the leg wires, drill
holes through the ends large enough to
receive said wires. Next divide the
skin of ears out to the points and place
a piece of tin in them the shape of ear.
Now turn the skin of head inside out
and sew up the mouth, draw the under
lip up under the upper lip and sew it
there so as when turned back the
stitches will not show. Next stretch
the hide on the bench and measure it.
In order to make the wire frame as
shown and described in wire frames,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Nos. 4 and 6, make the frame of suitable
malleable wire, and place it in as
shown, except the neck wire should be
passed out at nostril. First put the
skull in place and pass the neck wire
through the nose. Then pass the leg
wires out through the leg bones, or on
the inside of skin where the bone is
not large enough to receive it. Now
cut the tail wire long enough to reach
to end of tail and put it in place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, if the skin has not been previously
prepared with some of the preserving
preparations, powder the whole
inside with the arsenic and alum.
However, the head and legs have to be
prepared before putting in the frame.
We are now ready for the filling.
Stuff cotton in around the leg wires to
make the legs proper shape, being careful
not to get it in too tight. Take
some sand and mix some arsenic with
it; fill the tail with this, placing some
cotton at base of tail to hold the sand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>in. Now stuff the neck and body with
any suitable material, shaping and sewing
up as you proceed. Examine the
head, and where it needs filling out
pass the cotton in through nose and
ears, and shape it as in life, arranging
the ears, nose and mouth. Now pose
the specimen as you wish it to remain,
and place it in a cool, dry place
to dry. The leg wires should be bent
so as to allow the foot to rest on board,
and when dry the wires should be cut
off at bottom of feet, and the projecting
neck wire at end of nose should
also be cut off. Anoint the feet, nose
and ears with the preserving fluid once
a day for a few days. The wood and
wire frame is used in heavy animals,
the wood simply taking the place of the
wire along the back. By examining
the cuts it is easy to see how they are
to be used.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wishing to stand animals, such as
squirrels, groundhogs, etc., on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>hind legs, they have to remain on a
block or perch; so procure a suitable
block or perch, and varnish it before
putting the specimen on. Animals and
birds can be stuffed with hay, or anything
that you can get into them in
good shape. I often mow fine bluegrass
and dry it carefully, and find it
makes splendid stuffing, especially for
the bodies of animals and large birds.
Excelsior also makes a good filling.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>ON MOUNTING DEER HEADS.</h4>

<p class='c007'>In mounting a deer's head to look
life-like (having horns on), proceed to
skin, anoint with the preserving powder,
build up the nose with plaster
of paris, put in the eyes, sew up the
mouth and neck, for which see directions
in another article. Now take a
2×4-inch piece of pine for a neck support.
Fit the end of it in the brain
pit with plaster of paris. When the
plaster has hardened sew up the mouth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>as directed in cat. Draw the skin up
over the skull and sew the skin together,
drawing it close around the
horns. The skin being opened on back
of neck, sew it up to within six inches
of back end. Now make a board to fit
in back end of neck skin, and fasten it
to the neck support in such a way as to
hold the head on wall as desired. Tack
the skin around the board, being careful
not to draw the hair down. Stuff
the neck and finish sewing up. Cut the
skin off at back of board. Arrange
the whole head as directed in the cat
and set away to dry. See that the ears
and eyes are all right, and use plenty
of the preserving fluid. When the
head is completed make a suitable shield
to place on back end of the neck; this
should be of a neat pattern and nicely
polished. Fasten this on to neck board
with screws, then on the wall, also with
screws, which should be passed through
the shield, under edge of hair, to conceal
the heads of screws.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>ARTICLE III.<br /> A SIMPLE METHOD OF SKINNING, STUFFING AND PRESERVING FISH.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c013'>FISH DRESSING.</h4>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i074.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><em>No. 1.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Take a scale fish, say one that weighs
two pounds, more or less, and if a fish
on which the scales are tight, you can
skin and dress it without losing any of
the scales; but if a loose scaled fish, it
will be better to protect them as follows:
Take some tissue paper and press
it gently on one side of the fish, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>turn it over and treat the other side in
the same manner. The natural glutinous
matter which covers the scales will
be sufficient to make it adhere firmly.
Without this precaution the skin could
not be removed from some fish without
losing the scales, which would ruin the
specimen. When these papers dry, lay
the fish on its back, take a pair of scissors
and open the skin down the center
of the belly, beginning close up the
gills and running clear back to the end
of the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>The skin should now be taken off
with great care, using a smooth-edged
knife for skinning, and a pair of scissors
to clip the fins and other fine
bones with. After the body has been
skinned, take out the gills, tongue and
eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is now ready for the preserving
powder, which should be spread or
dusted over the inside of the skin, being
careful to reach all parts around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the gills, in the mouth, eye sockets,
etc. We now insert the frame E (see
cut No. 1), which is simply a wire bent
as shown in the cut, and sew up, beginning
at the tail and ending at the gills,
leaving the ends EE of frame projecting,
as represented in cut No. 1. We
now proceed to fill the body with plaster
paris. Mix up a sufficient quantity,
take a funnel, open the gills or mouth
and insert the tube of the funnel therein,
and pour in enough plaster paris to fill
the body. Handle the body carefully,
and shape it properly, while the plaster
is setting, being careful to keep the
frame EE straight with the body.
When the plaster has set (or hardened),
bore two holes in a rough board to set
the frame rods EE in, which will hold
the body up off the board. (See cut.)
Now proceed to stuff the head with cotton,
being careful not to press the gills
out of shape, then draw the mouth together
with a thread and tie it. Fill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the eye socket with plaster paris or
putty, and set the eye in the proper
position.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are now ready for the fins and tail;
if they have become dry, wet them
with water and spread them out; then
take a needle and thread and draw them
up, as shown in cut No. 1.</p>

<p class='c000'>To make the frame, take a rough
board, say one inch longer than the
fish you intend to dress. For a fish a
foot long, the board should be one inch
thick and about three inches wide, and
for larger fish in the same proportion,
or large enough to support the fish.
To one end of the board nail a piece
of lath a foot long (see D in cut); on
the other end nail a block (C in cut),
to which nail an upright piece (B in
cut). Tack the tail to the upright (B)
with tacks (P). Raise the upper fins
by drawing a thread through them and
tying to upright piece, as shown in cut.
Drive two nails in board (A), as shown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>(GH), to which fasten threads attached
to lower fins as shown in cut. Set
away to dry and when thoroughly dry
wash the whole body, take off the tissue
paper. When the fish gets dry, dampen
all the outer surface with corrosive sublimate
and set away. Take off the
threads and place it on a nice, smooth
board and give a light coat of varnish.
The specimen is then ready for the
cabinet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should you prefer to stuff the body
with cotton instead of using plaster
paris, proceed as follows: After skinning
as directed, make a frame, EE,
and take a straight piece of wire long
enough to reach from the point of the
nose to the other end of the body,
fasten this to the frame, EE, at the
upper end, by wrapping them together
with a small wire or cord, leaving the
frame EE as near the center as possible.
Take cotton or tow and wrap
the wire that is to run lengthwise of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the body, say one-fourth as big as the
body, then insert it in the skin and
proceed to stuff with cotton, being very
careful to get the natural shape. When
this is completed, proceed to sew up
and mount as directed when dressed
with plaster paris. The Gar fish makes
a fine specimen, by simply filling the
skin with dry sand while drying, and
let it out when dry.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>ARTICLE IV.<br /> HUNTING SPECIMENS AND CARE OF SAME.</h3>

<p class='c005'>In hunting specimens, birds or animals,
it is best to take a double-barreled
shot-gun, have your cartridges loaded
some with fine shot, and some with
coarse; keep one barrel loaded with one
number and the other barrel with the
other number, then you are ready for
either small or large game. Have some
cotton and old newspaper with you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and as soon as you kill a specimen, stop
up the shot holes with the cotton, and
it is sometimes best to stuff some in the
nostrils and mouth. If any blood has
run out on the hair, or feathers, as the
case may be, wipe it off carefully, then
wrap the body in paper and pack it in
the game sack, using all care not to
bend, break or soil the feathers, for if
once soiled it is hard to make the work
look well again.</p>

<p class='c000'>On removing the birds from the
game sack, if there is any blood on the
feathers, wash it out with clear water,
and wipe until nearly dry; then sprinkle
with plaster of paris and shake until
dry. In this way the feathers will
look smooth and natural; but if, after
washing, you let them dry without
stirring, they will present a bad appearance.
Where the blood has remained
on the feathers they must be well
washed and treated as directed in a test
case as given at close of Article I.</p>

<p class='c005'>The above cuts represent my wood
and wire frames for animals and birds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fig. 7 is Fig. 8 reversed; Fig. 8,
showing the way the neck and tail supports
EE are fastened to the body board
with blind staples. Fig. 7 shows the
way the leg wires AA are fastened in
the same manner. In making the
frame, measure the animal from shoulder
to hip, and cut the board a little
longer than the measure taken; round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the corners as shown in cuts, and round
the upper edges to keep them from cutting
the skin should it come in contact
with it. Now take a wire or rod long
enough to reach from the end of the tail
to the end of the nose, bend the wire
as shown in Fig. 8, and fasten it to the
body board with blind staples, unless
the specimen be a large one, then it
will be necessary to put them on with
strong wire staples. Next bend the
wires for legs as shown in Fig. 12,
which should not be fastened to the
board until after being placed in the
legs of the animal being dressed. They
are then bent up as shown in Fig. 13
and fastened to the body board with
staples to suit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The frame for birds is made in the
same way, excepting the forelegs, which
is used on bird frames only when wanting
to spread the wings. Fig. 11 is a

small birds. (See small bird page <a href='#Page_5'>5</a>).</p>

fasten them in a vice at the loop B in
Fig. 1, and plait the three together as
shown in Fig. 3. To form the Fig. 4
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>frame, make another loop two or three
inches or further up the neck wire E,
bend another wire as Fig. 2, put this
through the loop, and plait together as
in Fig. 3. This forms the frame for
animals, as shown in Fig. 4.</p>

<p class='c000'>For Figs. 5 and 6, lay three wires
together as shown in Fig. 5, put them
in a vise and twist or plait together as
shown in Fig. 6. This forms three
wire frames—Figs. 3, 4 and 6.</p>

<p class='c000'>The advantage Fig. 4 frame has over
Fig. 6, is that it is easier bent in the
center, there only being one wire.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>ARTICLE VII.<br /> MOLES.</h3>

<p class='c007'>It is not necessary to give more than
one way to dress a mole. An expert
can skin, stuff and sew up a mole in
ten minutes in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c000'>After killing a mole, let it cool; then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>make an incision along the abdomen,
commencing at the tail and running
forward two inches, or about to the
center of the body. Skin out the hind
legs, bone and flesh, down to the foot
and unjoint. Press the skin back to
the tail and unjoint it close to the
body. Pull the skin off the body,
taking care of front feet, not to pull
them loose from the skin; unjoint them,
or break the arm bone close to the foot;
skin on down to mouth and cut the body
loose, leaving only the jaw bones in the
skin. Spread on the whole skin all the
preserving powder that will stick to it,
and turn the skin back inside out.
Turn the hind legs and proceed to fill
the body with cotton, using a wire to
stuff the cotton in with, as in all other
animals, being careful not to stretch
the skin, and also not to get the cotton
knotted up. After the body is filled
sew it up and place on a board to dry.
Place the feet in position, and wet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>them and the tail and nose with the
solution of corrosive sublimate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other small animals, such as rats,
mice, ground squirrels, gophers, etc.,
can be dressed in the same manner.
After stuffing smooth the hair and
shape the body before laying away.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>ARTICLE VIII.<br /> MODE OF DRESSING AND PRESERVING TURTLES.</h3>

<p class='c005'>A good sized turtle may be thoroughly
preserved without the tedious
process of unjointing, skinning, digging
out the flesh, sewing up, etc., by
observing the following directions:</p>

<p class='c000'>Take a snapping, or any other hard
shell turtle, say one that measures ten
inches across the back, or smaller,
down to the smallest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first thing to be done is to kill
it, which is the hardest part of the operation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>as it clings to life tenaciously,
and large ones are very strong and hard
to manage. One way is to get it to
open its mouth, and catch it by the under
jaw with a pair of strong pliers,
hold its mouth open and make it swallow
a quantity of the solution of corrosive
sublimate; this being a deadly
poison, it will soon kill it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another way is to hold its head as
far out as you can pull it, and stick it
as close to the under shell as you can,
running the blade well back into the
body. It takes some time for it to
die after being stuck.</p>

<p class='c000'>And still another way is to open its
mouth and stick a knife blade up
through the roof of the mouth into the
brain.</p>

<p class='c000'>I prefer the poisoning, as it seems
to die easier and quicker, and it does
not disfigure it. As soon as it dies, lay
it on its back, and make an opening in
the skin, under one of the back legs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>large enough to take out all the entrails;
now take a pair of pliers or a
hook (made for the purpose); pull out
all the entrails, liver, heart, etc. If
the specimen is a large one, pour in
some water and rinse out thoroughly,
then put in a lot of the preserving
powder, being careful to get it well distributed
through the body. Then take
some cotton and dust it well with the
preserving powder, and fill up the inside,
pressing the cotton in tight, filling
the body full and sew up. Now open
the mouth and pour some of the solution
of corrosive sublimate down
its throat, and press some cotton
sprinkled with the powder down its
throat, being careful not to stretch the
neck out of proportion. Remove the
eyes and insert the artificial eyes in
their stead; fill the mouth with cotton
and close it. Cut a hole in the bottom
of each foot, and probe the legs with a
knife or the blunt end of a wire; pour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>in some of the solution of corrosive
sublimate, or work in enough of the
powder to preserve the flesh; if the tail
is a large one, it should be treated in
the same way, and all sewed up. Now
set it on a board and tack the feet to
the board in as near the way it would
hold them while walking as you can.
Pull the neck out a very little, and put
a little block or a small roll of cotton
under it to hold it up in position while
drying. Before putting it on the drying
board, take a small paint brush,
pour out some of the solution of corrosive
sublimate in a dish and give the
whole outer surface a thorough wetting.
This should be repeated once a
day for several days. This completes
the dressing. After the specimen is
dry, take it off the board and set in the
cabinet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another way: After killing, as directed,
lay the specimen on its back and
unjoint the breast shell from back shell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>with a chisel or heavy knife blade;
open the skin from the front part of
the foreleg back and around to front
of the other foreleg, cutting under the
legs. Skin out all the flesh and bones
of the legs and unjoint them at the foot,
skin out the tail, then unjoint the neck
bone from backbone, and skin it out
and unjoint at the back of the skull.
Take the flesh from back and breast
shells, then anoint all parts with the
preserving powder. Take a frame as
Fig. 8, in article V, of the wire and
wood frame, and put in legs, neck and
tail, as directed in animals, letting the
neck wire pass out through the mouth
or nostril. Stuff the legs, neck and
tail with cotton or tow, and sew up the
sides, leaving an opening to stuff the
body; fill the body, then finish sewing
up. In stuffing the legs, neck and tail
be careful to keep the wires in the center
of each. Open the mouth and take
out the eyes from inside and put in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>glass eyes; put some cotton back of
them to hold them in place while drying.
Close the mouth, and wet the
whole body with the solution of corrosive
sublimate. This should be done
once a day for several days. Place the
specimen on a board to dry. For position,
copy after nature as near as possible.
After the skin is dry a coat of
varnish adds much to its appearance.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>ARTICLE IX.<br /> KILLING AND DRESSING SNAKES.</h3>

<p class='c005'>To kill a snake without bruising or
breaking the skin is a difficult undertaking,
for, as a general thing, we are
not looking for snakes, therefore we
are not prepared to capture one.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we do run across them, we
generally kill them with the first thing
we get hold of. If the snake is not
too large, strike it across the back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>with a small stick. This disables him,
and you now have time to prepare to
finish him. Watch your chance and
when the opportunity presents itself,
tap it on the head a few times, and you
can soon kill it without bruising.
When it is dead, open its mouth and
cut the tongue and fangs out, then unjoint
the backbone from the skull and
skin back on the body an inch or two,
turning the skin inside out. Tie a cord
to the skinned part of the body and
pull on this with your right hand,
while with your left hand you pull the
skin off from the body, which is easily
done if the snake is not too large in the
center of the body; in that case it must
be opened in the largest part of the
body. Make the opening on under
side of body, lengthwise of the snake,
and long enough to allow you to remove
the skin all around the body,
then cut the body in two. Skin out
both ends, unjointing the body close to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the skull, turn the skin right side out
and sew up the opening, taking short
stitches. Now mix some plaster paris
and water, leaving it thin enough to
run; place a funnel in the mouth and
pour the plaster in until the body is
full. Lay the snake on a level board
and coil it before the plaster gets dry,
placing the head in the position in
which you want it to remain. Take
out the eyes and put in the glass ones;
then wet the whole skin with the solution
of corrosive sublimate. This
should be repeated once a day for three
or four days.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another method is to skin and sew
up as directed, then take a long wire
and stuff the body with cotton or tow,
being careful to get the stuffing in
smooth, so that no lumps will show on
the outside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another way is to fill the body with
sand, and when the skin has thoroughly
dried, make a hole in the under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>part of the body and let the sand run out.</p>

<p class='c000'>In either of the above modes the
snake should be coiled as soon as
stuffed in the shape you want it to remain,
and plenty of the solution of corrosive
sublimate used over the skin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Eels, frogs and toads are skinned
and stuffed in the same manner as the
snake, no frames being used.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>ARTICLE X.<br /> DRESSING ALLIGATORS.</h3>

<p class='c005'>Take an alligator, say five feet long,
make an incision the full length of the
body, on the under side, and skin out
all the flesh and bones, as recommended
in skinning animals. Scrape off all the
fat or flesh that may be left on the
inside of the skin, and give it a thorough
coat of the preserving powder.
Now proceed to stuff it without using
any frame. First stuff the legs with cotton
or tow, pressing it in very tight—their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>skin being very tough, there is no
danger of stretching it. Sew the neck
up, down to the front legs, and stuff
tight; now sew up the tail to hind legs
and stuff it; then take a piece of pine
board, say an inch thick, two inches
wide, and twelve inches long, place this
inside of the skin, draw the edges together
over it, and tack both edges
close together on the board, fill the
body up to the end of this board, and
put in another board in the same way,
and again stuff; when the full length of
the opening is closed up in this way,
before putting in the last section, have
the body thoroughly stuffed and put
the section in afterward.</p>

<p class='c000'>The advantage in putting in the board
is this: It is almost impossible to sew
the skin, and as it is to lay flat, it is
much easier to use the boards; they
could also be used in the neck and tail,
if you wish to lay them straight with
the body. Lay the specimen on a flat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>board, and place his feet and tail as
you wish to have them. The eyes
should now be removed, some of the
solution of corrosive sublimate put in
the sockets, then put the glass eyes in
with putty or plaster paris. Close
the mouth and set a block under the jaw
to hold it up while drying. Give the
body a thorough wetting with spirits of
turpentine, repeating it once a day for
three or four days. After the skin
becomes well dried give it one or two
coats of varnish and you have a fine
specimen.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>ARTICLE XI.<br /> DESCRIPTION OF FOOT-STOOL.</h3>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i096.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><em>No. 5.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Letter (A)
represents the
covering, (B)
the moss or hair
filling, (C) the
bolt which fastens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the horn to the stool brace, (D)
the tap of said bolt, (E) the wooden
base of stool, (F) a small rod or nail set
in the plaster paris, (G) a rivet through
the horn, (H) head to bolt, (J) plaster
paris in the horn.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING THE STOOL</h4>

<p class='c007'>Take three cow horns of good shape
and size; rasp them and sand-paper
down, as hereafter directed in Article
XII; then, after deciding what height
you want the legs, make a frame to
saw them off on, as illustrated and
directed in Article XII, cut No. 6.
After sawing off, drill a hole through
in the horn about three-quarters of an
inch from the large end. This hole
should be large enough to take in a ten-penny
nail. Put the nail through and
file it off even with the horn on both
sides, and rivet it with a small riveting
hammer. Now level up the ends of
the horns where they were sawed off,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>by taking a coarse piece of sand-paper,
and laying it on a level board, rub the
ends of the horn round and round on it
until it is perfectly level. Now take
the bolt C, of size and length to suit the
horn, put it down in the horn to see
that it will suit; sometimes it has to be
bent in the shape of the horn; after
fitting it to the horn, leaving about 1¼
inches projecting out to go through the
wooden base E and leaving room for
the tap D. Now mix some plaster paris
and water until about as thick as it
will run; pour this in the horn until
nearly full, put in the bolt, as shown,
and while the plaster paris is yet soft,
take an eight-penny wire nail and push
it down head first in the plaster paris,
leaving about half an inch sticking out;
this nail and the bolt should both come
straight up from the level of the end
of the horn. When the plaster is partially
dry, level up around the bolt and
nail at the end. The horn should now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>be polished as directed in Article XII.
The next is the wooden base E; have a
board turned or cut round, say twelve
inches across and one inch thick. This
should be made of walnut, or some
other hard wood, but when the hard
wood can not be procured pine will do.
If pine is used it should be painted, or
stained and varnished on the under side,
and if walnut it should be sand-papered,
filled and varnished. Now strike a
circle within about two inches of the
outer edge and bore three holes at equal
distances apart and set in the bolts;
when you get them in the position you
want them, press down on them to get
the imprint of the nails F, then remove
the horns and bore a hole the size of
the nails F. Now put the bolts in again
and screw the top on tight. The nail
F is to keep the horns from turning
around and getting out of place. See
that the butt of horn fits tight to the
wooden base E.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>
  <h4 class='c013'>UPHOLSTERING FOOT-STOOL.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Go to a saddler and get either curled
hair, deer hair, or moss sufficient for a
heavy pad; lay it on the floor and beat
all the dirt out of it, then pick it all
apart to get all the matted lumps out,
lay it on the stool top and pile it up
about a foot high while loose, take a
piece of muslin or drilling, lay it on
top of the moss or hair and draw all
the four corners down tight, tacking
them about the center of the edge of
the wooden base E, then draw it all
down and tack in the same manner,
drawing very tight, being careful to
get it round and even and leaving no
wrinkle. In case the moss is not evenly
distributed, take a long awl and run it
through the covering and carefully distribute
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next in order is the outside covering,
which should be a fine piece of silk
plush or velvet. Get a piece large
enough to work some fine flower or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>motto in the center, then put it on in
the same manner as the first, only tacking
it down near the lower edge of the
wooden base E; by being careful you
can get it on without wrinkling it.
The tacks should be small and very
close together. Put a piece of braid
around the edge and tack it on with upholstering
tacks and the stool is completed.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>SAWING OFF HORNS.</h4>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i101.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><em>No. 6.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Cut No. 6 is to illustrate a frame on
which to cut horns to be used for footstool
legs. Without a frame of this
kind it is almost impossible to cut them
to set level with stool and floor. In
fact, it is more difficult than it would
be for a carpenter to cut molding to
fit corners, etc., without a mitre box.
It is very simple and is made as follows:
For a frame large enough to cut four
horns, take a fencing board and cut off
a piece from it two feet long. The
board is supposed to be about six inches
wide and one inch thick. Saw off
another piece the same length and nail
it to the edge, as shown in cut. This
we will call the back of frame and the
other the bottom. The back then is
five inches high, measuring from bottom
board up. This completes the
frame as shown. The horns are now
placed on the frame and nails driven
around them into the frame to hold
them firmly in place. Place the horns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>close together in setting on the frame
and pour plaster paris over the points
of all, as shown in cut horn A. After
the plaster paris has thoroughly hardened,
saw off another piece of the same
board and nail it to front edge of bottom
board, and proceed to saw off the
horns level with the upper edge of back
and front boards, as in horn A. Should
you want the legs longer or shorter,
take wider or narrower boards for back
and front of frame. After taking the
horns from the frame, proceed to put
in the wire through the butt of horn
and rivet it; then put in the bolt and
nail F (as directed in a former article)
and fill the horn with plaster paris, as
shown in the above cut (C). The horn
is now ready, after polishing, to be
placed on the stool. It can also be
placed on a board and used for a hat
hook, or for holding back window curtains,
etc.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>ARTICLE XII.<br /> DIRECTIONS FOR POLISHING HORNS, HOOFS, ETC.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Go to a hardware store and buy two
good wood rasps, flat on one side and
round on the other; then get three
grades of emery or sand-paper, say No.
1, No. 0, No. 00; then go to a drug store
and buy ten cents' worth of sweet oil
and ten cents' worth of rotten stone.
Get an old felt hat and an old case
knife and you are ready for business.</p>

<p class='c000'>Take of either horns or hoofs, several
at a time, and put them in an old pot
or kettle of boiling water, let it boil
until they become soft, which usually
takes about half an hour; take out one
at a time and rasp it until it begins to
cool and harden, put it back and take
out another, and keep this up until all
are rasped down to the shape you want
them. Now take one at a time in the
same manner and scrape them until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>they are scraped smooth of all rasp
marks, using the case knife for the
scraper, the edge of which has been
ground square off like that of a shear
blade. Now take the No. 1 sand-paper
and sand-paper down, then use the No.
0, and finally finish up with the No. 00,
rubbing-lengthwise of the horn. We
are now ready for the finishing touch.
Take a piece of felt sufficiently large to
rub with, pour some of the sweet oil
on it, then dust with the rotten stone,
and give the horn a thorough rubbing,
putting more of the rotten stone on occasionally,
and keep up the rubbing
until you get a high polish. Such a
polish will remain on for years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another way to polish horns: Fasten
them firmly on a bench or to the wall.
Take a strip of ticking or felt about
three inches wide and three feet long.
Wet it in water and sprinkle powdered
emery over both sides. Take hold of
both ends, place it around the horn and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>draw backwards and forwards, around
and around, until the horn presents a
smooth surface; then take another strip
of the same description and use in the
same manner, except using rotten stone
instead of the emery. There are different
grades of the emery, and only
the finest is to be used in polishing; a
coarser grade can be used in the same
manner in the place of sand-paper, and
is very good.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>COLORING HORNS.</h4>

<p class='c007'>If you wish to give a horn a flesh
color, secure a very light colored horn,
rasp and scrape it down very thin, and
polish so that the horn is transparent.
Get some red paint (with plenty of
dryer in it) give the inside of the horn
a coat of the paint, and set it away to
dry. Before applying the paint, wash
the horn out well with soap and warm
water and dry well. The above gives
a beautiful flesh color, which will last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>for years, especially when filled with
plaster paris.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>TO REMOTE PLASTER PARIS FROM A HORN AND TO MAKE THE HORN ROUND.</h4>

<p class='c007'>After the plaster paris has become
thoroughly dry it is very hard; therefore
to cut it out with a chisel is very
tedious; but it often has to be done.
If the inside of the horn is smooth
and a little tapering, it is very easy to
remove by boiling it until the horn expands
or becomes soft; then tap the
horn with a smooth stick or hammer,
and the plaster will drop out in a
whole piece. If you have put a rivet
through the horn before putting in the
plaster paris it is more difficult to remove,
as the rivet holds the plaster
firmly in the horn. In such a case take
a chisel and dig out the plaster paris
down to the rivet, then either cut the
rivet with the chisel or file it in two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and take it out; then proceed as above
directed.</p>

<p class='c000'>To make the butt of a horn round,
put the horn in boiling water; let it remain
about ten minutes; have a round
wooden plug ready, which should be
wedge shaped; drive this in the horn
while hot, and let it cool; afterwards
remove the plug, and the horn will remain
round. This makes quite a difference
in the appearance of the horn
where you wish to use it for a hat rack,
footstool, etc.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>TO DRESS DEER HORNS.</h4>

<p class='c007'>Make an extra strong lye, using the
granulated lye and hot water, say one
tablespoonful of lye to half pint of hot
water. Give the whole horn a thorough
bath in the mixture, and let it set
about one hour; then take a stiff brush
and give the horns a thorough washing;
this cuts off all the dirt that has accumulated
in the rough knotty parts. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>horns should now be put in a barrel of
water and let soak a day or two, to
take off all the lye, then wash well
using a stiff brush. Now take an old
hand-saw and cut down through the
skull, commencing one inch back of
the horns and coming out at the eye
sockets, being careful to saw straight
through, so that when placed on a
board they will set level. Take a two-inch
pine block as wide as the skull and
three inches longer, round off the top
and bottom ends to suit the shape ox
the skull, place the horns on the block,
holding them there with the hands.
Put it up against the wall and if the
horns pitch too far forward take down
and cut off from the front of the board,
sloping it backwards until the horns
hang at a proper pitch. Now drill
about four holes through the skull, and
screw the skull fast to the board. Take
a dozen or more shingle nails and drive
in the front of board an inch or more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>apart, leaving the heads sticking out.
These are to hold the plaster paris,
which is put on to level up before putting
on the covering. After the nails
are all in, mix some plaster paris and
pour over the skull and around the
edges to round it up in shape for the
covering. After the plaster paris is
partially hardened, smooth it by scraping
down the high places, then let it
dry. Take a piece of strong unbleached
muslin large enough to stretch over the
skull and board, tack the muslin on the
back part of the skull board, then draw
it down between the horns and tack it
to the under side of the board at the
lower end, drawing very tight; now
commence at the edge of the muslin
and cut straight in to the inner side
of horns, round out a little for the horn,
and proceed to draw it all down tight,
and tack it on the under side of the
block, being careful not to make any
wrinkles in the covering; trim it off to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the tacks on the under side. (Some
prefer to have the muslin wet while
putting it on.) We are now ready for
the outer covering, which should be
plush or velvet, and is put on in the
same way as the first covering. It requires
some skill to make a smooth job
of the first; yet by going slow, any one
should do a fair job. Next make a
board to screw on the back of this,
which should be made in diamond shape
or rounding on both ends, and about
six inches longer and one inch wider
than the skull board; this should be
made of walnut and nicely varnished;
after it has thoroughly dried fasten it
tight to skull board with screws, counter-sinking
their heads. Bore one hole
at each end of the base board and
counter-sink them; then screw it to the
wall. Varnish the rough part of the
horns and let them dry; then take some
chenille or tinsel cord to trim around
the butt of the horns and around the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>back part or edge of the skull board.
Tack it on with upholstering tacks.
Cow horns and sheep horns are mounted
in the same manner. The sheep horns
should be cleaned with the lye, as directed
for the deer horns, but no scraping
or polishing is necessary; they look
better rough. The cow horns should
be polished, as directed on page <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>,
before they are put on the board. No
polished horn should be varnished.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>POLISHING HOOFS OF VARIOUS KINDS.</h4>

<p class='c007'>The cow hoof takes a high polish,
and a number of useful articles can be
made of them—which are not only
useful, but quite a novelty. Take a
pair of cow hoofs, which are neither
bruised nor scaled, rasp them down in
good shape, then scrape, sand-paper
and polish the same as directed in polishing
horns. The hoofs should be
good matches, and both from the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>foot. Bore or drill two holes in one
of them on the inner side, about one-half
inch apart, and place the two
hoofs side by side on a level board,
seeing that the toes are even with each
other. Take a piece of wire or an awl
and put through the holes in the hoof
and mark the place to make the holes
on the other, so that when they are
wired together they will set even with
each other. Drill small holes around
the tops, say a quarter of an inch apart;
take a piece of malleable wire of sufficient
size and draw it through the
holes in the sides of the hoofs, drawing
them firmly together, and twist the
ends of the wire together; this will
hold them in place. Bind the upper
edge of hoofs with piece of cloth, sewing
through the holes drilled for that
purpose. Stuff each hoof with tow or
moss, and stuff with any goods to suit
your fancy, silk plush, velvet, etc.
Put the filling in tight and let it come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>above the level of hoof to make the
cover rounding, then drawn down tight.
Draw the edges of the cover down and
sew them with a strong thread to the
binding. Take a piece of fancy cord
or ribbon and tack it around the edge
of the cover and you have a fancy pin
cushion. To make a match safe or
tooth-pick case, polish the hoofs, wire
together, and drill the holes around the
edge as before; then take some glue
and spread it well over the inside of
each hoof; cut some red flannel to fit
the inside and press it in with your fingers
until it is all smooth; cut it off at
the edge of top of hoof, and bind the
edges with ribbon. This makes a very
pretty match safe or tooth-pick case.
All hoofs are polished in the same manner.
Should the hoofs not set level
after they are put together, take a
coarse piece of sand-paper and tack or
hold it on a level board, set the bottom
of the hoofs on it and rub round and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>round until they do set level. It
would be best to attend to this as soon
as they are fastened together.</p>

<p class='c005'>A nickel-plated acorn, as
shown in the accompanying
cut, makes a very fine finish
on the point of a polished
horn. B is a wire stem attached
to the acorn, and is
intended for fastening it to the horn.
They are made as follows: If made of
metal, they are cast on the stem and
then turned. If brass, they are polished;
but if iron, turned and then
bronzed, painted or nickel-plated. If
made of horn, first put in the stem and
then turn and polish them. To put
them on the horn, saw off the point of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the horn, drill a hole in the end of
same, the size of the stem, put a little
glue in the hole and drive the stem in
tight. The horn should be polished
before putting the knob on. Round
knobs are also very nice, put on in the
same way. This way of putting them
on is much better and easier than the
old way of screwing them on.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>TANNING HIDES WITH HAIR ON.</h4>

<p class='c007'>Very little has ever been written in
regard to tanning skins with the hair
on. Indeed we may say there is scarcely
any literature on the subject, and this
article must necessarily be very brief.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Tanning with the hair on is always
somewhat difficult, but of course, some
hides are more difficult to tan than
others. As an average, I will here give
directions for tanning a dog hide. The
same process obtains in the tanning of
other hides. The only difference being
in the length of time required which
must be regulated to suit each case.
We will start with the skin on the
dog's back, and hence the first operation
will be the skinning process. To
begin, make an incision from middle
of under lip back along the median line
to the tip of the tail. Then make an
incision from the middle of each foot
along the inner side of the leg to the
median line, and proceed to skin, being
careful not to cut holes in the hide, and
at the same time to leave no flesh sticking
to the skin.</p>

<p class='c000'>When skinning the head cut the
gristle of the ear back close to the
skull and separate the skin as near out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>to the point of the ear as possible.
Unless this skin is separated, it is difficult
to tan the ears without losing the
hair, especially in warm weather. Be
very careful not to cut the eyelids;
skin on over the nose and cut loose
from the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then go over the pelt and remove
every particle of flesh which may have
been left on the skin, and be especially
careful around the nose and mouth.
All the bones of the feet should be
removed except the bones of the toes.
Next bathe the nose, ears, feet and
tail with the preserving fluids used in
taxidermy. If you have none of the
fluid, use plenty of arsenic and alum,
and then stretch the hide on a floor
with the hair side down and tack all
the parts so that they will be stretched
perfectly smooth, after which salt all
over thoroughly. Let it remain until
perfectly dry, and then take a piece of
coarse sand-paper and rub it down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>smooth and clear of any remaining
vestige of fleshy particles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Or instead of the preceding modus
operandi, remove the pelt from the
floor when about dry, and lay it on a
fleshing beam and with a fleshing knife
scrape off all remaining flesh and
grease. Should there be grease that
cannot be removed with fleshing knife,
tack hide back on the floor and spread
about three gallons of sawdust over it
and rub thoroughly. Clean the skin
and cover again with salt, and when
dry sand-paper as directed above. Next
place in warm water to soften it, and
when soft wash it thoroughly with
soap. Then rinse and wring it, and put
it into the following liquid which
should be contained in a wooden vessel.
The liquid consists of one gallon of
soft warm water, one-half ounce of
commercial sulphuric acid, and one-third
of a pound of corn starch. After
compounding, this liquid should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>stirred about ten minutes before the
skin is introduced. When the pelt is
put in, it should be pressed well under,
and stirred with a wooden paddle for
thirty minutes or until it begins to
thicken and turn a dark reddish color.
Then take it out and hang it up, and let
it drain about thirty minutes, after
which put it into a weak lye made
either from wood ashes or from concentrated
lye which may be bought in
any grocery store; strain the liquid before
putting the hide in. Stir the hide
in this lye about thirty minutes again,
or until you are satisfied the lye has
had time to neutralize the acid from
the preceding bath. The object of this
latter bath is to counteract the acid effect
of the former. Take out of the lye and
hang up and let it drain about one
hour, and then give it a thorough washing
on a wash-board with plenty of
soap and warm water. Rinse perfectly
clean and again hang up to drain.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>When the hair is nearly dry, tack it
again on the floor taking care to stretch
it into proper shape. When partly dry
take it up and rub and pull it until
soft, which completes the tanning. We
are then ready to place the skull in
position. After skinning the head,
remove the brains and eyeballs, and
then boil the skull until all the flesh
can be scraped from the bones. The
skull being ready, fill the eye sockets
with plaster paris made with water into
the consistency of a plaster, and then
set in a pair of suitable glass eyes, being
careful to so adjust them as to give
them the appearance of natural eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The under jaw should be wired to
the upper, or bound securely to it by a
small cord or wire. Saw the skull and
back corners of under jaw off, so that
when the sawed surface is fastened
down flat on a board, the nose will be
somewhat elevated from the floor,
while the back part of the skull will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>lie on the floor. Fasten the skull to
the small boards with wire, and then
stretch the skin over it. Soak only the
skin of the head in water, and sew up
the mouth by drawing the lower lips
up under the upper in the natural way.
The skin should be inside out while the
lips are being sewed. If in the process
of skinning you have cut the skin clear
out through the lip, it must be sewed
together far enough to inclose the skull
and the under board, which should not
extend more than two inches back of
the skull. Build out the end of the
nose with plaster paris to make it natural
shape and draw the skin over the
skull. Be very careful to have the
nose and eyes all right. Tack the skin
to the under side of the board which
should in width correspond to the thickness
of the dog's neck. The edges of
the neck skin should be sutured together
under the board and tacked to
it. Cut the skin, which is lapped under,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>following the line of back end of
board out to the side edges of the
board. Turn this flap out and sew the
underlying end to the upper skin, or to
the skin of back of neck, and close to
the back end of board; this brings the
skin on a level of under side of board;
now round off the turned out flap so as
to conform with the line of the neck
and fore legs; the head will now need
some stuffing to round it up in proper
shape. Take some cotton and put it
in through the ears with a wire, placing
it where needed to give the head
a proper shape; arrange the skin around
the eyes, nose and mouth; then let dry
before lining. Put a good supply of
the alcohol and corrosive sublimate on
the ears, nose and lips, as soon as head
is dressed. Now for the lining, procure
a sufficient amount of felt to line
it, say of a dark green color; then get
enough to make a strip one and a half
inches wide and long enough to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>around the edge of hide; this should
be an orange color.</p>

<p class='c000'>Take this strip and pink one edge of
it, then baste the lining on to skin
letting the edges of it project about
two inches out from edge of hide.
Now comb the hair around the edges of
hide back towards the center of same.
Then take the pinked strip and lay it
on the hair side of skin, the smooth
edge along the edge of the hide and
the pinked edge laying back on the
hair; then sew the pinked strip, lining
and hide together, running close to
the edge of hide. Now turn the pinked
strip out on to the projecting lining
and sew another seam around just out
side of the hide, thus sewing the lining
and the pinked strip together. Now
pink the out edge of lining to suit
your taste; then take some yarn or
zephyr and knot the lining and hide
together, the same as in knotting a
comfort, and the job is complete.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>To make a robe sew a number of
hides together and line them, simply
binding the edge with a straight strip.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>TO SOFTEN HIDES.</h4>

<p class='c007'>Where a hide has become hard by
getting wet, or from some other cause
after tanning, wet it on flesh side with
water and hang up. When partly dry
give it a thorough rubbing. If that
fails to soften it, oil it with Neatsfoot
oil and rub it in well.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>TO CLEAN RUGS AND FURS.</h4>

<p class='c007'>When rugs and furs become dirty
from use take hardwood sawdust, dampen
it and rub well into hide. Shake
out and repeat until clean.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>TO KILL MOTHS IN FURS, ETC.</h4>

<p class='c007'>Sprinkle them well with arsenic
shaking it well down on hide. Tie up
and lay away for a few days. Then
dust all the arsenic out and clean with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the sawdust. In stuffed birds use the
arsenic alone, but handle it with care
for it is a deadly poison.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
